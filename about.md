Disconnected Interactive Content Explorer (DICE) is an app for iOS, Android, and Windows that allows users to load interactive content generated in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to a mobile device so the device can display interactive content without a network connection.

DICE can be used by disaster response personnel, urban search-and-rescue teams, and others that need interactive content to assist with their tasks but the cell towers may be down. No content is included in the app. It must be loaded. The app merely is a container that can parse and display interactive content in a web browser on a disconnected device.

The DICE App was developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](https://www.nga.mil) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](http://www.bit-sys.com/index.jsp). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the MIT license.

You can find the DICE source code on GitHub for [iOS](https://github.com/ngageoint/disconnected-content-explorer-iOS) and [Android](https://github.com/ngageoint/disconnected-content-explorer-android)
